    <p>Variables are reserved memory locations to store values. By assigning different data types to the variables, we can store integers, decimals or characters in these variables. However in python we don't need to declare the data type, the declaration happens automatically when we assign a value to a variable.</p>
    <p> The operand to the left of the ' = ' is the name of the variable and the operand to the right of the ' = ' is the value stored in the variable.</p>
    <img src="../images/variables_1.png" alt='screenshot of terminal showing different data types'>
    <p>The above image shows three variables with different data types.
    	<br>'a' is an integer data type
    	<br>'b' is an float data type
    	<br>'c' is an string data type
        <br>The type function returns the type of a variable as shown in image.</p>
