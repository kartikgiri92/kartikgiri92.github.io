This repository contains the code for my static website - https://kartikgiri92.github.io.     
As the name suggests (Python Programs for Beginners) the website contains programs for python beginners.  
The site uses HTML and CSS and is hosted on Github.  
It was a practice project that I made while learning Html/Css.
